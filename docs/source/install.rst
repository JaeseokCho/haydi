Installation
============
For basic usage, Haydi has no external requirements.
If you want to parallelize the computation (see
`distributed environment <distributed.html>`_), the
`distributed <http://distributed.readthedocs.io>`_ library is required.

Haydi can be installed using ``pip``::

    pip install git+https://github.com/spirali/haydi.git

Haydi should be fully compatible with `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_
and you are encouraged to use it, as it can provide a substantial speed-up.
